#### Course FAQs

1. Where can I find the Jupyter Notebooks for the Course?

You can find them here.

2. How do I download the Notebooks?

Click the download button on the top right of the nbviewer page. Alternatively to download everything at once, you can go to the GitHub page here and then click the download zip button to download all the notebook (.ipynb) files onto your computer (compressed as a zip file, you'll need to unzip it).

3. How do I know where my Notebooks are being saved?

To find out where your notebooks are type: pwd in a cell. This will print your working directory.

4. How can I change where the Notebooks are being saved?

You will need to change the directory in which you are starting you jupyter notebook. Use cd in the terminal or command prompt to change to your desired directory.

5. How do I open .ipynb files? What program do I choose?

In order to open the Notebook Files you'll need to have Python and the Jupyter Notebook system installed, check out the Python Set-up section for more details on the installation of Python and the Jupyter Notebook system (or you can just follow the relevant instructions here if you feel more technical). Once you have python and the jupyter notebooks installed you are ready to open the notebooks using the following steps:

- First open up your Command Prompt (search for cmd on a Windows machine) or if you are on a Mac use your terminal (Spotlight search for terminal).

- Next in you terminal/command prompt type pwd and press enter (this will print your working directory)

- Take note of what file directory was displayed, this is where you should save your .ipynb files (or a folder containing your .ipynb files)

- Once your ipynb files or folder containing the files is in the location displayed from the pwd step go back to your terminal and type jupyter notebook and press Enter.

- After Step 4 you should have a browser tab open up with the Jupyter Notebook system running inside of it.

- Click on your Notebook (or go to your folder of Notebooks) displayed in the Jupyter Notbeook and it will open in a new tab with the Notebook you selected.

- You should now have successfully opened a Notebook file.
